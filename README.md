# TrueReview -IT358 Final

TrueReview is an iOS application developed with the aim of generating a more accurate rating than a five star system for business.

The goal was to generate this score using a sentiment analysis of user reviews submitted for a given business. Due to limitations from Yelp's API, the current ratings given by the app are not reflective of a businesses rating.

TrueReview Client is Written in Swift

TrueReview's backend is a Django environment running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 

Due to Free-Tier limits this project may not function if the environment has reached it's monthly free hour limit.
