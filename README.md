# TrueReview - Final Project

TrueReview is an iOS application developed with the aim of generating a more accurate rating than a five star system for businesses.

The goal was to generate this score using a sentiment analysis of user reviews submitted for a given business. Due to limitations from Yelp's API, the current ratings given by the app are not reflective of a business's rating.

TrueReview Client is Written in Swift 

TrueReview's backend is a Django environment running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 

Due to Free-Tier limits this project may not function if the environment has reached it's monthly free hour limit. 


# Running the project

To run the project, open the client folder, then open TrueReview.xcworkspace. Hit run. Open the debug pane of the simulator and set coordinates for location. May need to clean build folder and build 2 times for location coordinates to take.
